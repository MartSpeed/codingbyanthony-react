# **#code100**
<p>I have already started my coding journey and am currently 9 days into my new job position as a Full Stack Developer. However,I know that I still have much to learn. While I do have my Github repo lights to go off of and recount my work and experience. I am going to start my code100 journlaing today on Wednesday October 12th, 2022 @ 2300</p>

### *Daily Log*
---
- Day 1: started the create react app for robo friends in ZTM(38%), ending today on the Class vs. Functional App.js

<br>

- Day 2: started on Class vs. Functional Apps.js for robofriend project in ZTM(39%), ending today on the "Your first Class component" [work], working on a bug using dates and times and getting the difference using database calls converted to functional components and returned on a CSV file

<br>

- Day 3: created the start and styling of the robofriends using the link [Robofriend](https://robohash.org/) to pull the website API and use the components and props with prop destructuring for a more DRY code approach and succinct coding practices. Used tachyon css library to assist in styling to save work time flow. ZTM badge states that I am on Day 4 but I must have missed a day, but I will record each day like this that I have coded on my own terms as well. More is better so long as I do it everyday.
<blockquote>
    - <em style="color: orange"><strong>WORK</strong></em> : I am in themiddle of creating a calendar and punch in and punch out time entry, as well as a calculation to recognize the time between the last punch in and punch out from the current date to get proper time vales. <em><strong>manipulating dates is freaking difficult</strong></em>. My weekend project will deal with created calendars and making dates for more dynamic solution and code reinforcement using thr Date and time methods.

<br>

- Day 4: <span style="color: green">ZTM(40%)</span> finished the create app 2 section. Going to pause here to go over the .map() method and do more exercises to reinforce the understanding of how it is used and its breakdown to help destructure other peoples code when I come across the method again.

- Day 5: <span style="color: green">ZTM(42%)</span> went back to complete some sections in the DOM area to reinforce the super() operator, constructor operator practice. Took the rest of the day off. Had a bad migraine and nauseous feeling all day.

<br>

- Day 6: <span style="color: green">ZTM(44%)</span> completed the react app 3 portion. Picked up on how to better understand the STATE, CONSTRUCTOR, SUPER, and PROP operator. More practice with the filter method is needed, but I understand how to build them. Need more practice with the .map() method as well for setting them up and implementation. I also need to stop the amount of time that I procrastinate as well, i waste about 1 - 2 hours each day just trying to get started. Will add some extra videos to practice these isolated methods and implement them when I go into work as well. The STATE component needs a lot of review and practice before I move on to the next section, even though it is only styling.

<br>

- Day 7: <span style="color: green">ZTM(46%)</span> completed the react app styling portion of ZTM, went back to the advanced JS section to get reinforcement for the constructor, super method, .filter() operatoer, .map() operator, and other advanced JS methods. I go back to keep using them and adding it to old projects to build familiarity and understanding. In addition to the, converting old vanilla JS projects to react apps is a very fun personal challenge with plenty of repetition. I will continue grabbing old projects and converting them this way. For now I will continue getting in depth practice will props, state and more react methods

<br>

- Day 8: <span style="color: green">ZTM(46%)</span> I took the day off from personal coding due to imminent burnout, I had no more bandwidth to learn or take in information to make it useful to me or to implement.

<br>

- Day 9: <span style="color: green">ZTM(50%)</span> reinforced the react state and prop operators as well more destructuring reinforcement. I am going to keep converting old vanilla projects into react apps for that daily practice and start incoroporated the pomodoro technique to help with my time management, so I dont code all day everyday and have proper breaks between work and personal development. There are more items I need to add to my personal backlog so that I start to incorporate them into my daily task and uses for both myself and for work.

<br>

- Day 10: <span style="color: green">ZTM(51%)</span> did not code, due to a migraine that rendered me defunct

<br>

- Day 11: <span style="color: green">ZTM(51%)</span> did not code, due to a migraine that rendered me defunct

<br>

- Day 12: <span style="color: green">ZTM(53%)</span> worked on a few drills to push some reinforcement for the useState Hook, the useEffect Hook, and array methods: filter(), map(), sort(), and reduce for functionality and single code line practice. Need to do more advanced JS practices and incorporate them in each of my files when used to gain more understanding. The hooks still confuse me, so I will address some paired programming and so more drills to get a better handle on how to handle them.

<br>

- Day 13: ZTM(55%) worked on advanced JS to reinforce and practice more arrays and hashmaps for deeper learning and understanding. Started the react ztm course to dive deeper into react as a react dev for work and for overall knowledge

<br>

- Day 14: Web Dev(55%) | React Dev(6%) beginning the monsters rolodex react app to dive deeper into react developing and to reinforce the skills I currently have to build my knowledg and increase my productivity when I work. Need to prioritize better structured time when working and better implment the skills I currently have
